## About Me

#### I'm a full stack software engineer with a passion for creating products that will improve the quality of life for others. I am skilled in JavaScript, Node, React, Redux, Express, SQL, Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS. I also have a background in sales, and inventory management that allows me to bring my own unique perspective to the field. I am currently working on a project that helps users to manage, organize, and track daily tasks to maximize a person's efficiency.

#### On a more personal note, I am interested in video games and e-sports. One of my personal goals is to learn enough so that I could one day help create a video game. I enjoy watching my favorite e-sports teams competing in various different leagues in my free time.

#### As a full stack software developer I have enjoyed working on my current projects using React/Redux, PostgreSQL, and Flask/SQLAlchemy. I am always open to new opportunities and would love to learn more.
